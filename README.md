# Bankist - Number, Dates, Timers

#### Description:

This program is a simulation of a banking application. It defines multiple objects that represent accounts with different owners, movements (deposits and withdrawals), an interest rate, a PIN code, and other account-specific properties. The program also defines elements in the HTML page that correspond to different parts of the user interface, such as buttons, labels, and input fields.

There are several functions that perform various tasks related to the banking application, such as formatting dates, calculating the balance of an account, and displaying movements in the user interface. The program also defines event listeners that allow the user to interact with the application, such as logging in, transferring funds, applying for a loan, and closing an account.
